================================================================================
SECTION 1: TOTAL ASSET FEATURES (4 features)
================================================================================

1. total_asset_value
   ------------------
   Definition: Total current market value of all assets
   
   Formula:
   --------
   total_asset_value = SUM(current_value for all assets)
   
   Example:
   - Stocks: ₹2,50,000
   - Mutual Funds: ₹1,80,000
   - FD: ₹5,00,000
   - Gold: ₹1,20,000
   - Real Estate: ₹50,00,000
   total_asset_value = 2.5L + 1.8L + 5L + 1.2L + 50L = ₹60,50,000
   
   Interpretation:
   - < ₹5L = Low asset base
   - ₹5L - ₹25L = Moderate wealth
   - ₹25L - ₹1Cr = Good asset base
   - > ₹1Cr = High net worth
   
   Credit Impact:
   - Higher assets → Better collateral capacity
   - Can approve higher loan amounts

2. total_invested_value
   ---------------------
   Definition: Total amount originally invested (cost basis)
   
   Formula:
   --------
   total_invested_value = SUM(invested_value for all assets)
   
   Example:
   Stocks bought at ₹2,00,000 (now worth ₹2,50,000)
   MF invested ₹1,50,000 (now worth ₹1,80,000)
   total_invested_value = 2L + 1.5L = ₹3,50,000
   
   Interpretation:
   - Measures actual capital deployed
   - Used to calculate returns

3. num_asset_types
   ----------------
   Definition: How many different asset classes does consumer hold?
   
   Formula:
   --------
   num_asset_types = COUNT(DISTINCT asset_type)
   
   Example:
   Holdings: Stocks, MF, FD, Gold
   num_asset_types = 4
   
   Interpretation:
   - 1-2 types = Low diversification (risky)
   - 3-5 types = Good diversification
   - 6+ types = Well diversified portfolio
   
   Credit Impact:
   - Higher diversification → Lower risk
   - Shows financial sophistication

4. num_assets
   ----------
   Definition: Total number of individual assets
   
   Formula:
   --------
   num_assets = COUNT(all assets)
   
   Example:
   5 stocks + 3 MFs + 2 FDs + 1 property = 11 assets
   
   Interpretation:
   - More assets = More investment activity
   - Shows savings behavior


================================================================================
SECTION 2: LIQUIDITY FEATURES (5 features) - CRITICAL FOR UNDERWRITING
================================================================================

Liquidity = How fast can asset be converted to cash?

5. liquid_assets
   --------------
   Definition: Assets that can be converted to cash within 7 days
   
   Formula:
   --------
   Liquidity Classification:
   - T+2 (2 days): Stocks, Liquid MF, Digital Gold, Crypto
   - 3-7 days: Debt MF, Bank FD (with penalty)
   
   liquid_assets = SUM(value WHERE liquidity_days <= 7)
   
   Example:
   - Stocks: ₹2,50,000 (T+2) ✓
   - Liquid MF: ₹50,000 (T+1) ✓
   - Bank FD: ₹5,00,000 (immediate with penalty) ✓
   - Real Estate: ₹50,00,000 (6 months) ✗
   liquid_assets = 2.5L + 0.5L + 5L = ₹8,00,000
   
   Interpretation:
   - Emergency fund capacity
   - Can cover unexpected expenses/EMI defaults
   
   Credit Impact:
   - HIGH liquid assets = Lower default risk
   - Can liquidate if income stops

6. semi_liquid_assets
   -------------------
   Definition: Assets convertible in 8-90 days
   
   Formula:
   --------
   - 14 days: Corporate FD
   - 60 days: EPF withdrawal
   - 90 days: Insurance surrender
   
   semi_liquid_assets = SUM(value WHERE 8 <= liquidity_days <= 90)
   
   Example:
   Corporate FD: ₹2,00,000 (14 days)
   Insurance (surrender): ₹1,50,000 (90 days)
   semi_liquid_assets = ₹3,50,000

7. illiquid_assets
   ----------------
   Definition: Assets taking >90 days to liquidate
   
   Formula:
   --------
   - 180 days: Real Estate
   - 365 days: PPF (lock-in)
   - 1825 days: NPS (retirement lock-in)
   
   illiquid_assets = SUM(value WHERE liquidity_days > 90)
   
   Example:
   Real Estate: ₹50,00,000
   PPF: ₹8,00,000
   illiquid_assets = ₹58,00,000
   
   Interpretation:
   - Long-term wealth
   - Not useful for short-term emergencies

8. liquidity_ratio
   ----------------
   Definition: **KEY METRIC** - What % of assets are liquid?
   
   Formula:
   --------
   liquidity_ratio = liquid_assets / total_asset_value
   
   Example:
   Liquid assets: ₹8,00,000
   Total assets: ₹60,50,000
   liquidity_ratio = 8L / 60.5L = 0.132 (13.2%)
   
   Interpretation:
   - < 10% = Poor liquidity (risky)
   - 10-20% = Adequate liquidity
   - 20-40% = Good liquidity buffer
   - > 40% = Excellent emergency fund
   
   Credit Impact:
   - High liquidity → Can handle income shocks
   - Low liquidity + high illiquid assets = Risk
     (e.g., property worth ₹1Cr but only ₹50K liquid)


================================================================================
SECTION 3: RETURNS & PERFORMANCE (1 feature)
================================================================================

9. portfolio_returns_pct
   ----------------------
   Definition: Overall return on investment portfolio
   
   Formula:
   --------
   portfolio_returns_pct = ((total_asset_value - total_invested_value) 
                             / total_invested_value) * 100
   
   Example:
   Total current value: ₹10,50,000
   Total invested: ₹8,00,000
   portfolio_returns_pct = ((10.5L - 8L) / 8L) * 100 = 31.25%
   
   Interpretation:
   - Negative = Loss (poor investment decisions)
   - 0-8% = Below inflation (FD-like returns)
   - 8-15% = Good returns (beating inflation)
   - 15-25% = Excellent returns
   - > 25% = Either very good investor OR high risk taking
   
   Credit Impact:
   - Positive returns = Good financial management
   - Consistent losses = Poor decision making


================================================================================
SECTION 4: ASSET BREAKDOWN (7 features)
================================================================================

14. real_estate_value
    ------------------
    Total property value (residential + commercial + land)
    
    Example: 1 flat worth ₹45L + 1 plot ₹12L = ₹57L

15. pf_value
    --------
    Provident Fund balance (EPF + PPF + VPF)
    
    Example: EPF ₹6.5L + PPF ₹2.8L = ₹9.3L

16. insurance_value
    ----------------
    Surrender value of insurance policies (LIC, ULIPs)
    Note: Only policies with investment component
    
    Example: 2 LIC policies with surrender value ₹2.5L


================================================================================
SECTION 5: PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION (5 features)
================================================================================

17. portfolio_risk_score
    --------------------
    Definition: Weighted average risk of entire portfolio (0-1 scale)
    
    Formula:
    --------
    Risk weights:
    - Bank FD/PPF/EPF: 0.1 (very safe)
    - Corporate FD/Bonds: 0.3 (low risk)
    - Gold/Real Estate: 0.4-0.5 (moderate risk)
    - Debt MF: 0.3
    - Hybrid MF: 0.5
    - Equity MF: 0.7
    - Stocks: 0.8 (high risk)
    - Crypto: 0.95 (very high risk)
    
    portfolio_risk_score = SUM(asset_value * risk_weight) / total_assets
    
    Example:
    - FD ₹5L * 0.1 = 50,000
    - Stocks ₹2.5L * 0.8 = 2,00,000
    - Gold ₹1.2L * 0.4 = 48,000
    Total weighted = 2,98,000
    Total assets = 8.7L
    portfolio_risk_score = 2,98,000 / 8,70,000 = 0.343
    
    Interpretation:
    - 0.0 - 0.3 = Conservative (mostly FD/PPF)
    - 0.3 - 0.5 = Balanced (mixed portfolio)
    - 0.5 - 0.7 = Aggressive (mostly equity/stocks)
    - > 0.7 = Very aggressive (high risk)
    
    Credit Impact:
    - Conservative → Stable but lower returns
    - Balanced → Ideal for most borrowers
    - Aggressive → Higher default risk if market crashes

    Gold: ₹3,70,000
    Total: ₹60,50,000
    gold_to_assets_pct = (3.7L / 60.5L) * 100 = 6.1%
    
    Interpretation:
    - 5-15% = Healthy gold allocation (Indian norm)
    - < 5% = Low gold exposure
    - > 25% = Over-allocation to gold
    
    Cultural Context:
    - Indians culturally hold gold (jewelry, bars, coins)
    - Gold is liquid collateral for gold loans

    Example:
    Property: ₹57,00,000
    Total: ₹60,50,000
    real_estate_to_assets_pct = (57L / 60.5L) * 100 = 94.2%
    
    Interpretation:
    - > 80% = Over-concentrated in property (illiquid!)
    - 50-80% = High property allocation
    - 20-50% = Balanced
    - < 20% = Low property exposure
    
    Credit Impact:
    - Too high (>80%) = Liquidity risk
      Customer might default if can't liquidate property fast
    - Moderate (30-60%) = Good collateral + some liquidity

20. safe_assets_pct
    ----------------
    Definition: Conservative assets as % of portfolio
    
    Formula:
    --------
    safe_assets = fd_value + pf_value + insurance_value
    safe_assets_pct = (safe_assets / total_asset_value) * 100
    
    Example:
    FD: ₹5L + PF: ₹9.3L + Insurance: ₹2.5L = ₹16.8L
    Total: ₹60.5L
    safe_assets_pct = (16.8L / 60.5L) * 100 = 27.8%
    
    Interpretation:
    - > 60% = Very conservative (retired/near retirement)
    - 30-60% = Balanced approach
    - 10-30% = Moderate risk taker
    - < 10% = Aggressive investor
    
    Age-based guidance:
    - 20-30 years: 10-30% acceptable
    - 30-45 years: 30-50% ideal
    - 45+ years: 50%+ recommended

21. market_linked_pct
    ------------------
    Definition: Equity exposure (stocks + equity MFs) as % of assets
    
    Formula:
    --------
    market_assets = stocks_value + mf_value
    market_linked_pct = (market_assets / total_asset_value) * 100
    
    Example:
    Stocks: ₹2.5L + MF: ₹1.8L = ₹4.3L
    Total: ₹60.5L
    market_linked_pct = (4.3L / 60.5L) * 100 = 7.1%
    
    Interpretation:
    - > 70% = Very high market risk
    - 40-70% = High equity exposure
    - 20-40% = Moderate exposure
    - < 20% = Conservative
    
    Credit Impact:
    - High exposure during bull market = Great!
    - High exposure during bear market = Risky!
    - Need to check market conditions at time of loan
